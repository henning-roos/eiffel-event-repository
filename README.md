# Eiffel Event Repository
The Eiffel Event Repository provides a queryable persistence solution for [Eiffel](https://eiffel-community.github.io) events. It stores all events it is exposed to, and exposes a REST API through which events may be queried and their links traversed. Event persistence is a keystone capability in any implementation of the [Eiffel protocol](https://github.com/Ericsson/eiffel), allowing clients to not only parse events in real time, but also to query a historical record of past events.

Eiffel is a protocol for technology agnostic machine-to-machine communication in continuous integration and delivery pipelines, aimed at securing scalability, flexibility and traceability. Eiffel is based on the concept of decentralized real time messaging, both to drive the continuous integration and delivery system and to document it.
